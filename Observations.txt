#59 Observe Existing Community Platforms and Compile Findings

General Design Patterns
*	https://www.nomensa.com/blog/design-patterns-social-media/
o	This site talks about what social media is and how it's designed. One thing of note that 
they say is "to determine what kind of community you wish to encourage. Certain kinds 
of patterns will help promote certain kinds of behaviour."
o	We need to determine what we want our platform to be and design based around that 
idea.
*	https://decode.agency/article/what-is-mvp-in-mobile-app-development/
o	This article addresses an MVP (minimum viable product) in the mobile app development 
process. Many major apps started as MVP's in order to test the waters. It's a quick way 
to get a functional product out with the features in place that will be present in the 
more developed product. The benefit to this method is that it allows a quick way to get 
user feedback on a new product or new features so you can refine your ideas.
Facebook
*	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444569X22000063
o	This article employed a heatmap based on eye tracking data that they gathered. It 
largely focuses on how users are affected by the content that they see, but also dives 
into how "to optimize your Facebook page for optimal attention and awareness of 
posting." Which I believe will be useful in determining the layout and design of our own 
platform.

o	This article talks about the details of Facebook's system architecture.
*	https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/analysis-facebook-redesign-interface-concept/
o	This site puts forward multiple design options for Facebook in order to help UX along 
with explanations for why those designs work.
*	https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/03/facebooks-new-design-turns-your-pc-into-an-
enormous-phone/
o	Talks about the design of the new Facebook desktop app
*	https://uxdesign.cc/analyzing-facebooks-major-redesign-from-website-to-app-53ad2f88b0de
o	In 2019, Dark mode was implemented and seems to be an important feature to users 
across every app I've looked at.
o	Back button was also implemented with dark mode and is an important feature for iOS 
users who don't natively have a back button on their devices.
Reddit
*	Interview: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/wzq4rl/what_is_reddit_used_for_i_thought_it_was_
a/
o	A user on Reddit asked how others are using the app. Many users commented that they 
use it as a forum where they chat with others or to follow communities for hobbies or 
things that they're interested in. 
o	There is a clear separation on Reddit for different subjects and a homepage for each 
user, which they can curate themselves by joining different communities, that shows 
recommendations, new, or popular content.
o	By having separate sections of the site dedicated to the various topics and broadly 
covering everything, they are able to avoid the downfalls that many online communities 
face, which is covered in the "How do they fit together?" section of this website:
?	https://www.nomensa.com/blog/design-patterns-social-media/
o	Reddit also allows for direct messages, which may be something that we wish to 
implement.
o	Another feature that seems important to Redditors is the anonymity of the app. They 
are able to post without worrying about what they say coming back to them, which 
allows for more open communication, but definitely leads to some issues with racism 
and sexism.
*	https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/a-reddit-ux-case-study-89f41bca6a5d
o	Case study going over the UX of the Reddit mobile app and comparing it to its most 
popular competitors.
o	"Efficient use of whitespace in the UI can help get the message across quickly and 
improve user engagement. However, if used poorly, whitespace can make it harder for 
users to find what they need, too much whitespace can break readability. It can also 
make a page look cluttered and lazy, which can distract users from their purpose."
o	This site also shows potential redesigns for the Reddit app to help improve user 
engagement and experience that may be useful for us.
Quora
*	https://uxplanet.org/redesigning-the-quora-app-a-ui-case-study-c680ffe04915
o	Goes over the UX of the Quora app
o	Suggests multiple improvements such as:
?	Consistent use of colors throughout the site to make the user associate that 
color with the app
?	Simplified UI, removed gestures and added navigation to the bottom
*	https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/quora-ux-case-study-13dc3553fc36
o	All questions fall under the same domain and are separated by tags, where competitors 
like Stack Overflow use different domains to cover those various topics.
o	Quora allows option to edit posts, as do all the other Community Boards I've seen.
o	As with all the others, allows for commenting on posts made by others and has upvote 
system in place.
o	Problems with Quora UI:
?	Lack of Visual hierarchy and lack of distinction between posts and ads
?	The current information hierarchy shows the name of the person who answered 
the question first and then the post
?	Difficulty with accessing Topics and Sessions
?	Lack of accounts visibility
?	Inconsistent shapes of icons
o	 
?	This is an example of a prototype layout for Quora. A fairly similar design seems 
to be exactly what we're looking for.
