### Part 1: Organization and Role

**Org Chart**

<https://github.com/byui-cse397/2024WinCSE490PCP/blob/Week02/ProjectManagement/OrganizationChart/OrganizationChart.md>

**My Job:** As a member of the Requirements Team, my primary role is to focus on gathering, documenting, and verifying the needs and requirements for our project. This involves a lot of interaction with both user data and feedback to ensure our software development aligns with user expectations and needs.

**Point of Contact for Questions:** If I have questions or need clarifications, my first point of contact is the team lead. For broader project issues or insights into the overall direction, I would approach the Project Manager (PM), who coordinates between the teams and the stakeholders.

### Part 2: Summary of Agile

**What I Learned About Agile:**
Agile is a methodology that emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement. The training highlighted the importance of breaking down the project into manageable units, allowing for rapid adjustments based on feedback and changing requirements.

**Implementing Agile:**
I will implement Agile by actively participating in regular scrum meetings, maintaining open communication channels with my team, and adapting quickly to feedback and changes in project direction. This approach will help ensure that our deliverables are aligned with stakeholder expectations and project goals.

**Agile Stories:** Stories in Agile are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user. They are crucial because they keep the focus on the user's needs and serve as a clear guideline for what needs to be developed.

**My Capability:** My capability in this setting involves eliciting, analyzing, and documenting requirements effectively. It also includes actively engaging with stakeholders to refine and clarify the needs, ensuring that the development aligns with their expectations.

### Part 3: Create Stories

Based on the product development knowledge I've gained, here are four stories I will work on this week, with their estimated complexity:

1. **Story: Refine Prototype Elicitation Requirements**
   - **Complexity:** Medium
   - **Task:** Update and refine the existing prototype based on the latest user feedback to better meet the specified requirements.
   - **Expected Outcome:** A prototype that aligns more closely with user expectations and project goals.

2. **Story: Develop Basic Wireframe Elicitation Requirements**
   - **Complexity:** Low
   - **Task:** Create a basic wireframe that outlines the main components of our application, focusing on user interface and experience.
   - **Expected Outcome:** A wireframe that serves as a visual guide for further development and discussions.

3. **Story: Observe User Interactions and Compile Data Elicitation Requirements**
   - **Complexity:** High
   - **Task:** Conduct user testing sessions to observe interactions with the current system and compile data on usability and user satisfaction.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Detailed data that will inform adjustments in the software design and functionality.

4. **Story: SWOT Analysis Elicitation Requirements**
   - **Complexity:** Medium
   - **Task:** Perform a SWOT analysis to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the current project stage.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Insights that will help in strategic planning and risk management.

**Summary of Experience:**
This week's experience with creating and completing stories was enlightening. It highlighted the importance of clear and actionable user stories in driving the development process. The agile approach facilitated quick adjustments based on real-time feedback, which was crucial for meeting the dynamic needs of the project. By comparing planned outcomes with actual results, I gained valuable insights into the effectiveness of our planning and execution strategies, which will guide future sprints.
