### Project Tasking

#### Scrum Status

- **Accomplishments:**
  - This week, I recall having spent significant time in designing the user interface for the application. I also worked on refining the prototype based on the latest user feedback to better meet the specified requirements. This was done largely in photoshop and involved significant research in modern design and comparing current social media applications to my design to ensure it was up to date and user-friendly.

### Project Metrics

#### Time Tracking

- **This Week:**
  - **Hours Worked This Week:** It was something like 10 hours

- **Total to Date:**
  - **Total Hours on Project:** At this point about 30 hours combined
  - **Total Number of Tasks:** I believe it was something like 12 tasks at this point.

### Part 1: Security Definitions and Risk Statements

**Authentication**: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or entity. It involves confirming the authenticity of a claim made by or about the entity, usually by providing credentials such as a username and password, biometric data, or security tokens.

**Authorization**: Authorization is the process of determining whether a user, program, or device has the right to perform a specific action or access specific data within a system. This process occurs after authentication and ensures that the entity has the appropriate permissions based on policies and rules.

**Access**: Access refers to the permission or ability to use, manipulate, modify, or view a resource, system, or data. It is typically controlled and restricted by mechanisms enforced through both authentication and authorization processes.

#### Writing a Risk Statement:
A risk statement typically identifies the condition under which a risk arises, the event that could occur as a result, and the potential consequences of that event. It follows the format:
- **Condition**: The circumstances or background setting for the risk.
- **Event**: What might happen to cause a problem.
- **Consequences**: The impact or result if the event occurs.

#### Security Risk Statements for Each of the As

1. **Authentication**  
   **Risk Statement**: Given the condition that user credentials are stored without proper encryption, there is a possibility that these credentials may be accessed by unauthorized individuals, causing a security breach and potential loss of sensitive data.

2. **Authorization**  
   **Risk Statement**: Given that user roles and permissions are not regularly updated or reviewed, there is a possibility that former employees or unauthorized users may retain access to confidential systems, causing unauthorized data disclosure or manipulation.

3. **Access**  
   **Risk Statement**: Given that access controls are inadequately enforced or configured, there is a possibility that users may access resources beyond their necessary scope, causing data leakage, violation of privacy policies, or unauthorized transactions.

### Part 2: Create Software Development Folder

As the project progresses, it is crucial to maintain organized documentation and artifacts for each feature implemented. Below is the structure and content required for each story's software development folder.

**Folder Structure for Each Story:**

- **Task Description Document**
  - Contains the user story.
  - Specifies which requirements the story satisfies.
  - Details related design elements.
- **Difference Listing**
  - A document listing all changes made to the codebase.
- **Unit Test Cases**
  - Detailed test cases that cover all functionalities implemented in the story.
- **Review Report**
  - Summary of code reviews, including any issues found and resolutions.
- **Document Updates**
  - Logs of all updates made to documentation related to the story.
- **Code Check-ins**
  - Links to the repository where code is checked in.
- **Unit Test Runs**
  - Results from running unit tests to ensure functionality and detect bugs early.
